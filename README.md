  ## General info : 
  Initial Approach:

When approaching this project my initial thought process was to read through the requirements and satisfy all requirements by making a full-stack React.js application. I planned to use React.js, Formik, Yup for the validation, and Bootstrap with custom CSS for the styling and animations.

Woking in increments of 30 min, I began my typical workflow deciding on which technologies I needed. Next, I moved into building the markup adhering strictly to the wireframes. After the first 30 min increment, I realized I probably wouldn't have enough time to do everything so I would probably have to mock some functionality in vanilla JS and cut corners to finish as much as possible.

Reassessment: 

I planned on using the entire 6-hour window to work, foreshadowing the possibility that I might need to adjust my strategy, I set a timer on my watch for 3 hours to pause and pivot if need be. When The halftime alarm sounded I took a step back and decided I would be better off focusing on finishing less of the application and having a polished finish product for deployment. I can always keep tabs on plans for future deployment. My goal is to have some semblance of a finished and functioning product.

Conclusion & Future Development:

Hindsight is 2020. If starting again from scratch I probably would follow the initial wireframes more as a suggestion than as a strict guideline. I think I slowed myself down a  lot trying to match the wireframe exactly in the beginning.  I think my creativity is my best asset and if I would've allowed myself to be a little less critical I would have created a little more freely and showcased my design abilities more effectively.

For future deployment, I would like to implement Formik and Material UI. Also, I wanted to add a Hero carousel of some images with an overlay to make the Landing component a little more interesting. In the future, I would implement MongoDB and some seed data for the form functionality. Then I would focus on the visual hierarchy of my text, optimization of my images, do some Lighthouse auditing, and a few subtle transitions and animations.

Overall I think the exercise was exciting and refreshing. The time constraints challenged me as a developer and forced me to be more decisive and forward-thinking with my design decision and overall approach. Now I know which areas to focus on developing my skill set
